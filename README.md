# `Hello, world!`

I am 2'nd year student of MIPT DREC. I am learning programming and other subjects in MIPT.

Now I learning C++ language, in previous year I was learning C language. I was learning C languge on course by
[Ilya Dedinsky](https://github.com/ded32) that called Ilab, now I learning C++ on course of [K.I.Vladimirov](https://github.com/tilir).

## My C++ projects.

- [LFU Cache with compexity of request O(1)](https://github.com/LegendaryHog/cache)

- [Belady Cache with complexity of request O(log(cache.size))](https://github.com/LegendaryHog/belady_cache)

- [RAII class of Matrixes](https://github.com/LegendaryHog/matrix)
    - for this problem I wrote: RAII Array (my copy of `std::array`), class MatrixContainer provides interface of 2d array, in which you can swap rows and collumns by O(1), class MatrixArithmetic provides basic arithmetic operations with matrix, determinant of matrix, transponse matrix, inverse matrix, product of matrices. I wrote two algorithm of detrminant: Bareiss and Gauss.

- [RAII clas of RBTrees](https://github.com/LegendaryHog/SearchTree) 
    - my own version of `std::set` and specialization for HWT problem.

- [HW3D solution(Triangles)](https://github.com/LegendaryHog/Triangles)
    - geometric problem of intersection Points, Segmnets and Triangles in 3D. This project I wrote with my frined [Dany aka BileyHarryCopter](https://github.com/BileyHarryCopter). In addition to find collisons of all inputed shapes we must boost process by spatial partitioning algorithm, to can intersect 1m shapes pretty quickly.

- [Vector](https://github.com/LegendaryHog/Vector)
    - my own RAII version `std::vector`.
## My C projects.

- [Quadratic Equation Solution](https://github.com/LegendaryHog/quadratic-equation)

- [Onegin/Hamlet](https://github.com/LegendaryHog/Onegin)
    - Training project on first course of ILab. Problem
    take text in buffer, sort by end of lines, generate poem.

- [Stack](https://github.com/LegendaryHog/Stack)
    - attempt to write RAII Stack in C, I cannot say that I did perfect interface and errors handing, but that was a good try. 
- [Processor(Assembler)](https://github.com/LegendaryHog/Pentium)
    - Assembly language with assembler and processing programms. I did code generation with macros for better debugging))).

- [Array based list](https://github.com/LegendaryHog/List)

- [Queue](https://github.com/LegendaryHog/Queue)

- [Hash Table](https://github.com/LegendaryHog/Hash_Tab)

- [Binary tree based Akinator](https://github.com/LegendaryHog/AkiTree)
    - Akinator game, you can see tree of this akinator with MIPT persons in README.md.

- [Calculator](https://github.com/LegendaryHog/Calc)
    - calculator, which use recursive descent algorithm

- [Differentiator](https://github.com/LegendaryHog/Diff)
    - I didn't finish this problem. I wrote input of function, building binary tree by function, differentiation of tree, simplification of tree, but didn't write output of equation, i don't know why, because its not hard.
